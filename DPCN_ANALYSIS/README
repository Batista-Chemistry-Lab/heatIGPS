**Turning Up the Heat Mimics Allosteric Signaling in Imidazole-Glycerol Phosphate Synthase**

by *Federica Maschietto, Uriel N. Morzan, Florentina Tofoleanu, Aria Gheeraert, Apala Chaudhuri, Gregory W. Kyro, Peter Nekrasov, Bernard Brooks, J. Patrick Loria, Ivan Rivalta, Victor S. Batista*

The following commands can be used to reproduce the DPCN analysis described in section  *Allosteric activation vs. temperature increase: a structural perspective* of the article.


The source code to run the DPCN analysis can be downloaded from the Git repository by Aria Gheeraert at the following link:
[pmdlearn](https://github.com/agheeraert/pmdlearn)

The dpcn networks discussed in the paper are saved in the two binary files below

DPCN_asymmetric_NH.dfp 
dpcn.dfp

Figure 3E in the paper can be reproduced using the following commands

run `pymol igps.py` (in this folder)

the holo30 - apo30 can be visualized as:
draw_from_df('dpcn.dfp', w2='30H', w1='30', color_sign=True)
and the apo 50 - apo30 as:
draw_from_df('dpcn.dfp', w2='50', w1='30', color_sign=True)

One may want to display the same normalization factor for the edge size in different figures. This can be done as:\
draw_from_df('dpcn.dfp', w2='30H', w1='30', color_sign=True, edge_norm=20)
draw_from_df('dpcn.dfp', w2='50', w1='30', color_sign=True, edge_norm=20)


To display only one amino acid network without coloring:
draw_from_df('dpcn.dfp', weight='30H')
